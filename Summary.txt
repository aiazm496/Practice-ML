Four people died as a pro-Trump mob stormed the U.S. Capitol for nearly four hours on Wednesday afternoon, violently clashing with law enforcement in a bid to help President Donald Trump overturn his defeat in the November election.

As a result, the Congress, which had convened to certify Joe Biden's election victory, was evacuated midway. Both the House and Senate reconvened after a brief period and is currently continuing the process.

Videos showed people breaking windows and pressing past barricades to get inside. Lawmakers from the Senate and the House of Representatives were evacuated. After he repeatedly posted false accusations about the election, Twitter and Facebook suspended Mr. Trump's account for violating user policy.
